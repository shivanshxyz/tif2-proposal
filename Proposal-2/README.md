# Proposal-2 : TezTunes - Democratising music streaming monopoly to empower musicians

## Problem Statement

The current system of music industry is broken it puts artists at a disadvantage (especially small independent artists) since 80% of their streams comes from streaming services like Spotify/Apple music and a very minority of views from TV/radio. But streaming services only accounts for 15% of their revenue. Even small artists who get millions of streams gets paid in pennies at the end due to the monopoly of streaming services. Artists are struggling to make sense of the mess that is royalty distribution in its present form and find it difficult to keep the fair share of the revenue they generate on existing platforms.

## Solution

- Create a decentralized music platform which will provide freedom and transparency to the artists. Uncensored, fair and easy to use â€“ a system that gives a greater choice to listeners and fair market value compensation to artists.

- Using Tezos blockchain and storing all the songs on IPFS, there is no central server and so the storage costs are drastically reduced. This allows for more of the revenue to go directly to the artist, in a more secure, transparent way than ever before.

- The service will operate on a subscription based model where people will pay periodically in XTZ and artists get paid in XTZ per stream. The goal is to provide maximum possible percentage of the revenue to empower artists.

- XTZ holders can govern all the aspects through voting, including critical decisions such as inflation for artist payouts or which artist should be banned.
